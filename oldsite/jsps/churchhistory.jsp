Our congregation was started under the leadership of Rev. Fr. Babu K. Mathew in 1984. The first worship services were held at the Reformed Church on Clinton Ave in Bergenfield, NJ. 
</div>
<br/>
<div>
By the Grace of God, within 10 years, we purchased our own Church building at 52 E. Johnson Ave, Bergenfield NJ. Subsequently in 2007, we purchased the adjacent house property at 50 E. East Johnson Ave, Bergenfield and then 92 Taylor St property in 2009. 
</div>
<br/>

<div>
As the Church membership grew, we looked at several options to expand the Bergenfield Church. In due course, we renovated the balcony section to accommodate the growing needs. When the Church faced challenges to further expand its current building, the Congregation started exploring options for another site in the Bergen County area.

<div>
With the guidance of God Almighty, we identified a dilapidated Church building for sale in Midland Park, NJ which would meet our needs if it could be restored well. After significant due diligence and coordination by Church members, we purchased the building in August 2011 along with a parsonage next door. After approximately 16 months of renovations, the property on 497 Godwin Ave, Midland Park, NJ was brought back to its full glory as a Church. St. Stephen's Malankara Orthodox Church was consecrated by H.G. Zacharias Mar Nicholovas on December 21-22, 2012. 
</div>
<br/>

<div>
The Midland Park Church is ideal for our congregation for the next phase of our growth. It accommodates more than 300 parishioners for Holy Qurbana inside the Church and the same in the Parish Hall for other functions. The Church building has more than 10 large rooms for Sunday School and other activities. The premises also accommodate approximately 60 parking spots for our members.
