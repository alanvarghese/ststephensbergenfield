				The St. Stephen's Youth Movement was originally formed in October 2007. The 2012-2013 office bearers for the Youth Movement were elected on March 30th, 2012 under the guidance of our Achen and President Rev. Fr. Babu K. Mathew. There are currently about 40 actively involved members in this organization and the following were elected: Vice-President: Jessica Joseph, Secretary: Rinsu George and Treasurer: Sherin Thomas. The Youth Movement meets once a month after Holy Qurbana.

				This year, Jeby Mathew and Joby Mathew went to the 2012 Leadership Camp held in Detroit. We also held various retreats in our Church and our members attended many conferences at our sister churches such as the Second Annual ONE Conference, Annual Back to School Conference, FOCUS meetings  and the Women's Conference.

				To help raise money we held a Car Wash over the summer of 2012. The youth invited Deacon Gabriel Pike as the youth's guest speaker for Camp Starlight 2012. Our members volunteered to assist and help out with the Area 3 Sunday School Competition held at the Bergenfield church. For Hurricane Sandy, our youth held a coat drive to help the victims who had suffered from the tragic incident. Towards the end of the year we held a Bake Sale to help raise money for a new sound system. During the transition from the Bergenfield Church into the Midland Park Church, our members helped out as much as they could by helping clean out the old church and move things into the new church. We hosted the MGOCSM 2013 Lenten Retreat held for Staten Island, Central New Jersey and Rockland and North Jersey in the Midland Park Church. To end off our year we held our 3rd annual Fastover at the New Church.

				By the grace of God we were able to accomplish this many things over this year. We ask that you continue to keep our Youth Movement in your prayers as we continue to grow together in Christ and work for the church. With God's grace we are hoping to accomplish more tasks such as fundraising, charity and community work while in the new church for the New Year.
