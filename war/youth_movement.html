              <h1>Youth Movement / MGOCSM report</h1>
              </p>
              <p>"A Church without Youth is a Church without a future. Moreover, Youth without a Church is Youth without a future."   - Pope Shenouda III, Pope & Patriarch of Alexandria.</p>
              <p>There are currently about 75 actively involved members in this organization, as well as the elected office bearers:</p>
	      <p>Vice President  - Anol Abraham <br />
                Secretary - Sara Cherian <br />
                Joint Secretary - Elijah Mathew  <br />
		Treasurer - Timothy Mathew 
              </p>
              <p>In 2015, we have tried to be as active as possible by involving ourselves in several activities ranging from our Annual Fastover to various charity events. During the summer, the MGOCSM was given the opportunity to take part in organizing the OVBS. Many of our members volunteered to teach the classes, lead praise and worship, and organize the games session. The MGOCSM held a car wash to fundraise money for the Nepal victims. Although it was a rainy day, we were able to raise a good amount of money, especially with all the help of our fellow church members. Also, more than 20 members of our church attended a food bank in Hillside and it was truly a great experience to give back to our community. Several of our talented young boys took part in basketball tournaments along with our fellow sister churches. They also played as a band and led Christian praise and worship at several area events and retreats. Throughout this year, the members of the MGOCSM made a tremendous effort to attend and hold retreats, including the Lenten Retreat, the Back to School Retreat, and the Thanksgiving Conference. Through bake sales and our car wash, we were able to raise a great deal of money which we plan to use in the near future for many purposes, including charity donations and other spiritual events that will help bring our members closer together. With God's grace, we hope to accomplish more tasks and participate in even more events, such as community service and fundraisers, for the benefit of our church. We also thank all our church members and the committee members for their never-ending support and encouragement. We wish the office bearers of next year the best of luck and offer our help and support. We kindly ask for everyone's prayers so that we can have another fruitful year.</p>
              <p>Sincerely,<br />
                Sara Cherian (Secretary)<br />
